# Module android/sovereign

Sovereign is an autonomous-centric FTC utility library created by FIRST FTC team 19922. It's goal is
to make the prototyping and development of autonomous (and teleop!) modes easier and faster for
advanced and rookie teams alike.

Built to be flexible, Sovereign can adapt to many situations. Are you are a rookie team who would
prefer to use the traditional `loop` and `init` functions? What about a more adventurous team
wanting to type out command-style programming, the likes of which you might see in WPILib in FRC?
Maybe you'd like to use a state machine, or five? It's also possible you want to go your own way
and do your own thing, and in all of these cases Sovereign has you covered. Want to implement your
own pathfinding logic or use someone else's? You can do that. What about include a component another
team has made? That's also possible. Sovereign is stupidly flexible.
