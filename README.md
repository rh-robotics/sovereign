## Sovereign
Sovereign is an autonomous-centric FTC utility. It's goal is to make the prototyping and development
of autonomous (and teleop!) modes easier and faster for advanced and rookie teams alike. Sovereign
lets you go where you need to go, how you need to, when you need to.

## Panopticon
Panopticon is a tool that receives data from your robot, and allows you to mutate and spy on robot
state in real time. Complete with graphs, a property inspector, a 3D view of the field and more,
it's a great way to troubleshoot your code.
