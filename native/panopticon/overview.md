# Module Panopticon
Panopticon is a library for viewing the status of your robot remotely, debugging pathfinding, and
more. It's designed to replace FTC-Dashboard, and be integrated closely with Sovereign. While it's
not required, we've found it quite useful.

Panopticon is lead by the same people leading Sovereign.
